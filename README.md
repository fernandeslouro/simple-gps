# simple-gps

Graphical visualizer of points and coordinates of Portugal. The program draws real coordinates of the country. 
You can choose different cities and a road between them will be shown - this part of the program essentially solves a Shortest Path Problem.

Besides district capitals, the program also includes all the municipality capitals in the country. When uniting two municipality capitals (assuming they are in different districts) the road will cross district capitals.
